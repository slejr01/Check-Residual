# Check-Residual
Tool for controlling residuals from calculations of water surface, which are located in log.run file

The program will extract needed data (Time and Final residual of P_rgh, omega, and K) from log.run. These data will be used to create a graph which can be used for easy and effective moderation of Residuals. Extracted data are also simultaneously saved in Results.json for easier access to data.
